# React todo app

## What?
A basic todo app built with react, with an aim to have high test coverage.

## Why?
I've built two react projects following tutorials, and one as part of a 4 person team, but I want to try building something from scratch (well, still bootstrapped with create-react-app), without a tutorial, on my own.
Also a nice way to practice my CSS.

## How?
_Exactly_ like this.
